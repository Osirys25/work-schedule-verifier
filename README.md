# Work Schedule Verifier

## Project description
This project is designed to showcase my skills in developing REST APIs. Below you'll find a brief overview of the task requirements and instructions.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a REST API that provides two main services:

1. **Checking the 11-hour rest rule for a submitted schedule**: This service will verify if the submitted work schedule complies with the 11-hour rest rule.
2. **Returning a list of recent schedule verifications along with a list of errors**: This service will provide a history of recent schedule verifications and any associated errors.

## Requirements

- Docker
- docker-compose

### Request Body

The request body should be a JSON object containing two properties: `employees` and `employeeShifts`.

#### employeeShifts

An array of employee shift objects. Each shift object should have the following properties:

- `employee_id`: The unique identifier of the employee (string).
- `start_time`: The start time of the shift (string, ISO 8601 format).
- `end_time`: The end time of the shift (string, ISO 8601 format).
