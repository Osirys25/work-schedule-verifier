# Work Schedule Verifier

## Project description
This project is designed to showcase my skills in developing REST APIs. Below you'll find a brief overview of the task requirements and instructions.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a REST API that provides two main services:

1. **Checking the 11-hour rest rule for a submitted schedule**: This service will verify if the submitted work schedule complies with the 11-hour rest rule.
